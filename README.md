# Student Spending Habits Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of student spending habits using a comprehensive dataset that includes various financial aspects such as income, expenses, and financial aid. The analysis is designed to uncover trends and provide actionable insights into how students manage their finances across different age groups, majors, and payment methods.

## Key Features

- **Age Group Analysis:** Explores the relationship between non-tuition expenses and different age groups, revealing proportional spending patterns.
- **Major Influence:** Investigates how academic majors impact financial aid and expense distribution, highlighting variations in financial support and spending behavior.
- **Expense Distribution:** Analyzes spending on school essentials across different majors and income levels, offering insights into budgeting needs.
- **Payment Methods:** Examines the effect of different payment methods (cash, credit/debit card, mobile payment) on overall expenses.
- **Tuition and Financial Aid:** Assesses how tuition and financial aid consistency across different years in school affect student spending.

## Key Insights

1. **Age Groups:** Spending patterns increase proportionally with age, indicating a need for age-specific financial literacy programs.
2. **Majors:** Financial aid and spending vary significantly by major, suggesting the necessity for tailored financial support strategies.
3. **Expense Distribution:** Spending on school essentials correlates with overall income and financial aid, emphasizing the importance of targeted budgeting.
4. **Payment Methods:** The choice of payment method has minimal impact on total expenses, highlighting the need for greater awareness about different payment options.
5. **Tuition and Financial Aid:** Consistent tuition and financial aid levels across years suggest these factors have a minimal effect on long-term spending behavior.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Enhanced Data Segmentation:** Further analysis by additional demographic factors to uncover more nuanced insights.
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** Track spending habits over multiple years to identify long-term trends.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Utilize interactive dashboards for more dynamic data exploration.
- **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from students to refine recommendations and better align with real-world experiences.
